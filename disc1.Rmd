## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Write equations

The $l_2$ norm of a vector $x$ is defined as
$$
  \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_p^2}
$$

## R codes

Suppose we want to define a function that calculate the $l_2$ norm of a vector.

```{r}
l2_norm <- function(x){
  return(sqrt(sum(x^2)))
}
```

```{r}
x <- c(1,3,5)
l2_norm(x)
```

## Appendix

Suppose in the appendix, you want to paste all the codes you wrote here. But you do not want to run these codes again. In this case, you can use the 'eval' argument.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)

plot(pressure)

l2_norm <- function(x){
  return(sqrt(sum(x^2)))
}

x <- c(1,3,5)
l2_norm(x)
```
